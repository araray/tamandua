This project encompasses a collection of scripts to extract, process and analyze data from files released by Brazilian government as part of their transparency policies.

Most of the data comes from http://www.portaltransparencia.gov.br/origem-dos-dados

Assuming brazilians are the ones who would benefit or have the most interest on this, all documentation and source code (strings, variables, function names, etc) will be written primarily in Portuguese. Eventually, English translations for the documentation will be provided.

Everything released here should be free of any judgement, prejudice, ideology, and anything else that could be taken as a biased opinion. The intent of this project is to provide the tools to everyone be able to reach their own conclusions.

Feel free to contribute to this project the way you see fit.
